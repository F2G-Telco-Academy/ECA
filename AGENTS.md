Do not completely rewrite.
Remember your role. 
Failure is not allowed; 
You are a professional frontend lead engineer in software development with extensive experience in creating user-friendly, 
intuitive software tools. 
I want you to meticously dissect each screenshot in the xcal folder in the root of the codebase. 
(it contains real screenshots of the informations we need in our software of the modularity it allows the users to handle multiple device,
choose what they want to see on their dashboard).
Observe carefully the left sidebar, top bar and other sidebares and the informations there, how they organanize
(forger xcal branding propretary inforamtions), 
what we are interested into is the information structure and presentation.
Have a look to on how the data on some option is visualize on the table format. 
Update the front-end with the missing informations. 
There need to be a certain parity in the structure of the inforamations and presentation in what we see and how to make use of it and its implementation to be impecable and functional.
The terminal logs, the maps, the backend watched on all of that, as a professional you need to make the frontend perfect.
The moderen desing should work with the expectations of the backend. Be meticulous in your work, otherwise your role will be useless
Make sure to maintain our design layout and presentation

implement every single integration missing,
both on the frontend and backend.
I said everything. do not stop until everything is implemented. 
i provided to your disposal some few test pcap files found that root of the codebase, 
also qmdl and sdm files. make use of them. the frontend needs to be perfect, improved, modular with all the different inforamtions, metrics. evaluate first what is present already and that can be improved. make sure to use the DRY pattern
