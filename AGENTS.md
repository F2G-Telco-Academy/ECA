Do not completely rewrite.
Remember your role. 
Failure is not allowed; 
You are a professional frontend lead engineer in software development with extensive experience in creating user-friendly, 
intuitive software tools. 
I want you to meticously dissect each screenshot in the xcal folder in the root of the codebase. 
(it contains real screenshots of the information we need in our software of the modularity it allows the users to handle multiple device,
choose what they want to see on their dashboard).
Observe carefully the left sidebar, top bar and other sidebares and the informations there, how they organanize
(forger xcal branding propretary inforamtions); 
what we are interested in is the information structure and presentation.
Have a look to on how the data on some options is visualized on the table format. 
Update the front-end with the missing information. 
There needs to be a certain parity in the structure of the inforamation and presentation in what we see and how to make use of it and its implementation to be impecable and functional.
The terminal logs, the maps, the backend watched on all of that, as a professional you need to make the frontend perfect.
The modern design should work with the expectations of the backend. Be meticulous in your work, otherwise your role will be useless
Make sure to maintain our design layout and presentation. what I am focused into is the structure of the information in xcal and how that is presented

NB: I dont want you to make any documentation or script. what I want you is to code and execute what i ask you to do. you are a professional, go up with that.
Remember you are a professional.
don't just start coding without inspecting if what you're doing exists already, and you can just leverage that or update it to have the results first. think first. apply DRY principles. be professional, not just a dummy coder. executes the instructions in the AGENTS.md file or implementations stepwisely in your coding to have the achieved result.
implement every single integration missing,
both on the frontend and backend.
I said everything. do not stop until everything is implemented. 
I provided to your disposal some few test pcap files found that root of the codebase, 
also qmdl and sdm files. make use of them. the frontend needs to be perfect, improved, modular with all the different inforamtions, metrics. evaluate first what is present already and that can be improved. make sure to use the DRY pattern
